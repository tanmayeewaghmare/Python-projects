# Python-projects
These are the projects I have done using Python programming language
1. Best Bars in Minneapolis: This project focuses on using 'BeautifulSoup' library in Python to scrape data from website. Through this scraping exercise, I compiled a list of best 44 bars in Mineapolis-St.Paul areas by scraping website 'www.mspmag.com'
